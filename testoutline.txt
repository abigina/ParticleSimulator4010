Particle tests
    - GetPosition
        - use the function, compare to direct access of location data in each particle struct
    - GetBrownian
        - plot or test that it is sufficiently random (eye-check)
    - SetPosition
        - set position to outside the box
        - then look at position directly, location data
        - do this for each point outside each of the six faces

Simulation tests
    - CreateSimulation
        - check the values
    - CreateParticles
        - eyetest for random
        - generate variable numbers of particles
        - make sure all particles in the box
        - make sure there are enough particles
    - Update
        - test setposition
        - test order of functions
    - distance
        - calculate distance linearly
        - calculate distance through the walls
    - netforce
        - calculate force linearly
        - calculate force through the walls
    - generate particles manually
        - assign locations directly
        - test suite of particle positions
    - write to file
        - confirm locations of particle in model and in VMD
    - full stack test
        - limited particles and limited updates

testprog1(num particles, box, array of positions)
createparticles
for particle in particles:
    setposition(some numbers we already know)
run some test
